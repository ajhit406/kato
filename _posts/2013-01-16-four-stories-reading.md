I'm excited to be reading as part of the [Four Stories Reading Series'](http://www.fourstories.org/event-featured.html) 2013 Opening Night in Boston. 

Here's the official posting:

Four Stories is a literary series bridging Greater Boston’s nightlife and arts community (and now Osaka's and Tokyo's, too!). Each event is held in a club, bar, or lounge, and features appearances from some of the most acclaimed authors in the nation, all reading their work under a unified theme. It was founded and is run, in both Japan and the U.S., by the bi-continental-and perpetually jet-lagged-freelance writer [Tracy Slater](http://www.fourstories.org/about_tracy_slater.html).

The idea: to bring writers and readers, intellectuals and club-goers, friends and interested people together in a more upscale environment than a bookstore, to think, drink, eat, talk, laugh, hear stories, trade tales. It's simple, amusing, thought-provoking, and free for entry.
 
The experience: like a 19th-Century salon, only 150 years later―same socializing, same witty banter, corsets optional.
 
The Four Stories style of literary investigation: ask the best question; win a free drink!
