For those of you in China these days, I welcome you to attend two events at the Shanghai Literary Festival at which I will be either signing books or reading from an essay contribution. 

Friday, March 15, at 7pm, I'll be attending and signing books at the Shanghai launch of [_Unsavory Elements and Other True Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China_](http://www.facebook.com/UnsavoryElements), at the Glamour Bar. Tickets can be purchased [here](http://www.mypiao.com/ticket/100050032).

On Sunday, March 17 at 11am, I'll be reading from my essay contribution to Unsavory Elements and speaking on a panel as part of the Beijing Capital Literary Festival. Tickets are available [here](http://www.mypiao.com/ticket/100050086).

I look forward to being a part of this great event and hope to see many familiar (and soon to be familiar) faces in the crowd!
