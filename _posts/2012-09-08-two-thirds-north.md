My short story ‘Flying Lessons,’ about a young woman learning how to fly decades after her pilot father nearly crashes a plane himself, is featured in _Two Thirds North_, a literary journal published by the University of Stockholm. An audio reading of the story will be available online soon.

From the [_Two Thirds North_](http://www.twothirdsnorth.com/two-thirds-north-2012/) website:

Two thirds north is someplace that is not fully there. It is an orientation, somehow suggesting direction but vague enough for us to get lost. If one were to orient by latitudes, Stockholm, at about 60° N, is two-thirds the way between the equator and the North Pole. But on that sphere one can imagine an infinite number of radians, from any number of points, crossing here at a node of creative focus. And that is what this publication is. This year we have radians – writers’ voices – converging here from Britain, Canada, Hong Kong, India, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and the United States. And we have submitting writers from around the globe who dwell here in Stockholm, as well as natives of Sweden and this city.

There is an also impurity in our name, suggesting a fraction or incompleteness that evokes a need for the next word, the next poem or story. Here is a mixture of identities, nationalities and conditions of existence, neither fully one thing nor another, and many of us write out of that fractionality.

_Two Thirds North_ is the initial volume of what will continue as an annual anthology of poetry, short fiction, non-fiction, memoires, interviews, graphics and photography. This year’s submissions seemed to cluster themselves around several distinct themes in the mind of this editor, themes we have used to organize the volume.

This anthology of writing from _Two Thirds North_ can be [downloaded](http://www.twothirdsnorth.com/two-thirds-north-2012/) for free or purchased in hard copy for $10.
