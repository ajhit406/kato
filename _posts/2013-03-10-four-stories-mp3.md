title: Four Stories Reading: MP3 Now LIVE!
lnav: index
---

Last week I read at the 2013 launch of the amazing Boston- and Tokyo-based[Four Stories Reading Series'](http://www.fourstories.org/event-featured.html). For those of you who missed the event, the MP3 of my reading is now live and available for listening [here](http://www.fourstories.org/mp3/FourStories_KaitlinSolimine_3.5.13.mp3).

Was quite the evening full of raucous revelry. The winning question based on my reading was asked by a plucky young man: "In preparation for your writing, how many American Nurses did you have to smell?" Very clever and worthy of the free drink! (The answer? Listen to the MP3 to find out.)
