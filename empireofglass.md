# Empire of Glass, The Novel

Kaitlin Solimine’s debut novel, _Empire of Glass_, explores the unlikely intimacy between an elderly Chinese man and a young American woman.

The man, ‘Baba,’ has experienced eighty years of China’s turbulent modern history—as a witness of his mother’s death in the Sino-Japanese War, an artillery spotter during the Korean War, a glass grinder who unexpectedly falls in love during the Cultural Revolution, and as a bystander during Beijing’s transition from a Communist capital to the economic powerhouse it is today. Despite living through dramatic historical moments, Baba defines his life by the women in it—including the American, Katie (or ‘Lao K’ as he calls her). When Baba is diagnosed with a brain tumor, Lao K attempts to write the narrative of his life before it’s too late. Yet increasingly, she cannot distinguish between fact and fiction—in writing his story, she’s both conspirator and witness to a wartime rape he may have committed.

An experimental investigation into the workings of human memory, _Empire of Glass_ raises questions about the utility of international borders, the veracity of oral history, and the limits of language. The work, propelled by the exigencies of death, asks us how we define ‘life’—National Book Award finalist [Sarah Shun-lien Bynum]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Shun-lien_Bynum) has called the novel ‘a portrait of a soul.’
