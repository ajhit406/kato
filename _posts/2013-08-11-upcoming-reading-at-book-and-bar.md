A happy update from the jungles of Costa Rica: I'll be returning to New England to read alongside the illustrious writers Susan Conley and Matt Polly at [Portsmouth Book & Bar](http://bookandbar.com/) on Monday, August 26 at 7pm. 

[Susan Conley](http://www.susanconley.com/) is the author of recently released (and already well-acclaimed!) novel Paris Was the Place (Knopf), as well as the memoir The Foremost Good Fortune (Knopf). 

[Matt Polly](http://www.mattpolly.com) is the bestselling author of American Shaolin and Tapped Out.

We will all be reading selections from our essays published in [Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China ](http://www.amazon.com/Unsavory-Elements-Stories-Foreigners-Loose/dp/9881616409/ref=cm_lmf_tit_1). The book, a collection of 'expat' stories from the Middle Kingdom (including pieces from Peter Hessler and Simon Winchester) is now available on Amazon Kindle with pre-ordering of the paperback available as well.

For more on the book, read this [China Daily](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-07/26/content_16836230.htm) article about Unsavory Elements,  also featuring an interview with yours truly. 

For those in the New England area, I really hope to see you there!
