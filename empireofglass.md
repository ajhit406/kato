Kaitlin Solimine’s forthcoming debut novel, _Empire of Glass_, explores the unlikely intimacy between an elderly Chinese man and a young American woman.

An experimental investigation into the workings of human memory, _Empire of Glass_ raises questions about the utility of international borders, the veracity of oral history, even the limits of language itself. The work, propelled by the exigencies of death, asks how we define ‘life’—National Book Award finalist [Sarah Shun-lien Bynum]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Shun-lien_Bynum) has called the novel ‘a portrait of a soul.’

An excerpt from Empire of Glass can be read in [Guernica Magazine]( http://www.guernicamag.com/fiction/american-nurse) and was awarded the [Dzanc Books/Disquiet International Literary Program Award]( http://disquietinternational.org/contest-scholarships/contestscholarships), judged by Pulitzer Prize finalist [Colson Whitehead]( http://www.colsonwhitehead.com/Site/Home/Home.html). Another excerpt, 'Thoughts of Sinking,' is forthcoming in [Kartika Review](http://kartikareview.com).
