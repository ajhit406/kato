<p>My article, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/09/01/expat-adoptions-raise-logistical-legal-cultural-challenges/" target="_blank">"Expat Adoptions Raise Logistical, Legal, Cultural Challenges,"</a> was published in both the online and print (Sept. 3) versions of the Wall Street Journal. It was an honor to speak with several expat women who have built families abroad through adoption.</p>
<p>A previous article I wrote about the expat entrepreneur community, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/03/30/the-rise-of-the-expat-preneur/" target="_blank">"The Rise of the 'Expatpreneur,"</a> was published in the Wall Street Journal on March 30, 2015.</p>
