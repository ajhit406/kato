I’m excited to announce I will be serving as the Guest Fiction Editor for _Cha: An Asian Literary Journal_’s March Issue (#20).

[_Cha: An Asian Literary Journal_](http://www.asiancha.com/) is now calling for submissions for Issue #20, scheduled for publication in March 2013. Please send in (preferably Asian-themed) poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, reviews, photography & art for consideration. Submission guidelines can be found [here](http://www.asiancha.com/guidelines/). Deadline: December 15, 2012.

_Cha_, founded in 2007, a decade after the handover, is the first Hong Kong-based English online literary journal; it is dedicated to publishing quality poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, reviews and photography & art. _Cha_ has a strong focus on Asian-themed creative work and work done by Asian writers and artists. It also publishes established and emerging writers/artists from around the world.

The journal had a launch in Beijing on 31 August 2009 by [Royston Tester](http://chastaff.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/royston-tester/). _Cha_ is catalogued in the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) Library, among other universities.
