title: China Daily Article on Unsavory Elements
lnav: index
---

It was such a pleasure reading and speaking alongside such amazing authors at last week's [Shanghai and Beijing Capital Literary Festivals](http://www.m-restaurantgroup.com/mbund/literary-festival.html). The cherry on top was the fact that the anthology to which I contributed an essay, _Unsavory Elements and Other True Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China_, is not only now published but also was featured in a full page spread in the internationally-distributed English language newspaper, China Daily.For the online version of the article, click [here](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2013-03/19/content_16318386.htm). 

The piece does a great job highlighting the Beijing event as well as my fellow contributors with whom I shared pages (special thanks to [Matthew Polly](http://mattpolly.com/) for winging a Shaolin Temple-style kungfu display on command). And a huge shout out to editor and photographer extraordinaire [Tom Carter](http://www.tomcarter.org/), without whom the book would never have come to such beautiful fruition.

The Amazon release of the book is set for coming weeks -- expect an update on how and where to purchase your copy of the book soon!
