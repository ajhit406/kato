<p style="text-align: justify;">Maura Elizabeth Cunningham's LA Review of Books review of How Does One Dress to Buy Dragonfruit? True Stories of Expat Women in Asia, featured a kind mention of my essay that was included in the collection. I highly recommend reading the full collection, which can be ordered on Amazon here.</p>
