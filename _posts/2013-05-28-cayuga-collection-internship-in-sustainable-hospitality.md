I’m thrilled to announce my husband Joseph and I will be serving as this year’s coveted [Cayuga Collection interns](http://blog2.cayugaonline.com/cayuga-collections-interns-joseph-smolen-and-kaitlin-solimine/#.UaV14GT5n_l) in Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

Forbes called the position [“The Best Job Ever”](http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetrodgers/2013/03/08/rainforest-tour-at-lapa-rios-eco-resort-costa-rica/) --as interns, we will experience the best the collection has to offer on a “working vacation” that involves help with recycling, composting, beach cleanups, tree planting, wild cat tracking, and local schools and charities.
