title: Glimpse of a Rewrite, Empire of Glass
lnav: index

“A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people.” 
― Thomas Mann, _Essays of Three Decades_

The revision of my forthcoming novel _Empire of Glass_ has, much of the time, felt like trudging uphill, in mud, with long woolen pants on, while drunk and premenstrual. But then I stumble upon a story that matters to me, or a scene, and remember why I got myself into this mess in the first place.

As such, I thought I'd share a glimpse into the rewrite, the opening of a mid-novel chapter in which the main character finds herself in a strange place, at a strange time. That place is China. That time is now.

Chapter: Teratoma

In early morning’s sunlight, even China’s smallest cities have an air of glittering, golden importance. In Shangyu Station’s main square, an abandoned bag of ketchup-flavored potato chips somersaults across the soot-stained pavement. A few migrants linger beneath the appreciated shade of a sole birch tree, its trunk tattooed with the names of idle passersby:
	_Zhang Xuli was here 8/12/12_
	_Call Yingling for a good time!_
	_Kang Loves Pang_ 
	
The tree’s small, pear-shaped leaves fan the breeze with the impassivity of an old man sitting on a bench attempting a crossword. “Second tier cities,” western media calls them. But here is a third tier city, if Shangyu’s lucky. Shangyu is trying to be something Great (capital “G”), desperately so, but from all sides discarded farmland and empty, sullen villages pull at the city’s tattered suburban edges, reminding the city where it came from, a tragedy-riddled past the heart just cannot shake.  

Nearby Cao E River, a heavily-polluted waterway that pulses, begrudgingly, north to Hangzhou Bay, bears the namesake of a fourteen-year-old girl famous for dying in these waters. She’d been trying to retrieve the body of her father, Cao Xu, who himself drowned while officiating a ceremony to honor Wu Zixu, the Wu Clan’s eldest ancestor, most famous for his filial piety—-Wu, a modern-day model of loyalty, something long lost in China. A cursed river? Perhaps. No body of water should ever sustain so much death.

But I don’t yet know of this river or the story of Cao E as I walk across the square to a cluster of idling buses coughing exhaust into the stale morning air. Despite the nearby muffled sounds of industry (jackhammers chattering cement, eighteen wheelers squealing to a stop, a megaphone shouting today’s sales), the square is surprisingly quiet, protected by the soft golden light spilling from a petulant sun. There are clouds, yes, but today the sun is determined to win the battle.

I’m about to board a bus to Cen Cang Yan when I feel a tap on my shoulder.

“Menglian.” 

I turn and there’s a nervous-looking man smiling at me like he’s in the circus. I can’t help but notice his greasy, unwashed hair, the grimy lines etched into his neck’s fatty folds. In third tier cities, personal hygiene is a luxury. Perhaps for this very reason and that stupid smile, I can’t help but like him. 

“Menglian, I’m Baba’s Cousin Ming,” he says. “Where’s Baba?”

We both turn to look at the sad, empty square. The bag of ketchup-flavored chips has rolled to obsolescence. We both want to be anywhere but here. I know this without asking.

“Ba...” I begin. I wish I had a better answer. “Um, I don’t know?”
