I had the great honor to read as part of the illustrious [Vermin on the Mount Reading Series](http://vermin.blogs.com/vermin_on_the_mount/2012/10/look-whos-coming-to-vermin-la-kaitlin-solimine.html) in Echo Park, Los Angeles, and curated by [Jim Ruland](http://laist.com/2005/09/12/laist_interview_jim_ruland.php).

The event took place at [826LA](http://826la.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting students ages 6-18 with their creative and expository writing skills, and to helping teachers inspire their students to write. 826LA provides after-school tutoring, writing workshops, assistance with student publications, and much more. If you have a passion for writing and live in Los Angeles, I highly suggest you contact 826LA about becoming a volunteer.

At the event, I read an excerpt from my forthcoming novel, [_Empire of Glass_](http://kaitlinsolimine.com/empireofglass.html).
