Here's more on Kartika Review:

Kartika Review is a national literary arts magazine that publishes Asian Pacific Islander American fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, and art. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization sponsored by the Asian Pacific Islander Cultural Center (APICC). Kartika launched in September 2007 and has since published original works by David Mura, Russell Leong, Min Jin Lee, Tess Gerritsen, Peter Bacho, Porochista Khakpour, Bryan Thao Worra, Kelly Zen-Yie Tsai, Don Lee, Alexander Chee, and more. We have interviewed writers such as Yiyun Li, Peter Ho Davies, Jamie Ford, Nami Mun, Suheir Hammad, among others.

Kartika Review serves the Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) community and those involved with Diasporic Asian and Pacific Islander-inspired literature. We scout for compelling APIA creative writing and artwork to present to the public at large. Our editors actively solicit contributions from established virtuosos in our community in hopes their works here will inspire the next generation of virtuosos. Kartika also promotes emerging writers and artists we foresee to be the future powerhouses of their craft. Ultimately, Kartika strives to create a literary forum that caters to and celebrates the wordsmiths of the Asian Diaspora.
