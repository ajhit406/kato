##The Next Big Thing: On my forthcoming novel, Empire of Glass
“The Next Big Thing” blog train is officially rabid. I’ve been honorably infected, being passed the baton from the venerable [Tracy Slater](http://thegoodshufu.wordpress.com/). Tracy is the author of the forthcoming memoir _The Good Shufu: A Wife in Search of a Life Between East & West_ (Putnam Press), the story of a Boston feminist becoming a gaijin wife in Osaka, Japan. Her reading at the March issue launch of _Cha: An Asian Literary Journal_ (read an excerpt [here](http://www.asiancha.com/content/view/1400/396/)) moved me to tears; her work is both honest and tender, exposing the boundlessness of love beyond borders.

###What is your working title of your book?
_Empire of Glass_

###Where did the idea come from for the book?
Having lived with my Chinese family, the Chens, off and on for a decade, I felt I had unique access to what it’s like as a foreigner living in a Beijing household. In 2006-2007, I was lucky to be awarded a U.S. Dept. of State Fulbright creative arts fellowship that granted me funding for a year of research in China. During that time, I interviewed my family and traveled with my Chinese father (my ‘Baba’) to his hometown in rural Zhejiang province. 

Originally, I’d planned for the book to be a work of creative non-fiction, but as the story developed, I couldn’t help but formulate a fictional basis. Now, the story involves war, love triangles, and Falun Gong practitioners, all of which are only loosely based on the Chen family history. 

###What genre does your book fall under?
Literary Fiction

###Which actors would you choose to play your characters in a movie rendition?
Ha. Do authors think like this? Oh wait, I guess I do. Originally, I imagined Mira Sorvino as the American protagonist, mostly because she speaks Mandarin, but now, unfortunately, she may be a bit too old to play the part. Now, I see Elizabeth Olsen because I think she can tackle a complex multi-cultural role. For the character of young Baba, actor Han Dong (from Jiang Wen’s In the Heat of the Sun) for his impetuousness. For the character of his young wife, the talented Chinese actress Ning Jing. And they would all speak Chinese in the film with English subtitles!

###What is the one-sentence synopsis of your book?
Empire of Glass explores the unlikely intimacy between an elderly Chinese man and a young American woman through the lens of nearly a century of Chinese history.

###Will your book be self-published or represented by an agency?
Empire of Glass is represented by William Clark Associates and is currently undergoing revision.

###How long did it take you to write the first draft of your manuscript?

I thought I’d written a first draft prior to my entrance into my MFA program at UCSD in 2009, but in reality, that draft was part of the process of learning how to write fiction (so it’s hard to say whether that was a true first draft or something else – but it did have a beginning, middle, and end!). I’d say I really finished my first draft in 2011 and it took me 18 months. Since then, I’ve rewritten the book twice; this is currently my third major complete rewrite (as writers know, there’s a big difference between ‘rewrite’ and ‘revision’).

###Who or what inspired you to write this book?
Living in China as a teenager in the mid-‘90s was a formative experience. I was thrown into the Chen family home and they immediately took me in as if I were truly family. I felt I owed it to them and those interested in China to write a story that explored the intersection of real and human US-China relations beyond the well-traveled tropes of politics and economics. 

###What other books would you compare this story to within your genre?

This is a tough question because I don’t think there’s ever a true comparison between books; that said, some of my favorite reads include Kundera’s Immortality, Murakami’s Norwegian Wood, Iyer’s The Man Inside My Head, Petterson’s Out Stealing Horses, Ondaatje’s Coming Through Slaughter, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Wang Shuo’s Wild Animals, Greene’s The Lonely American, Pound’s Cathay, Lu Xun’s short stories, Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet, and Chuang Tze’s Collected Works. Now that I’m looking at it, that’s a depressingly male-centric list. Strangely, when I was younger, I read mostly female writers, like Lucy Maud Montgomery, Judy Bloom, then later, Sylvia Plath, Emily Bronte, Kate Chopin, and Virginia Woolf. Something tells me I should return to my roots.

###What else about your book might pique the reader’s interest?

In the latest revision, the protagonist finds herself following her aging Chinese father back to his hometown; in doing so, she untangles her involvement in her Chinese mother’s death, a story that now involves Falun Gong and a sliding scale of ‘reality.’


Now, I’m excited to introduce [Hope Wabuke](https://twitter.com/HopeWabuke), a friend and fellow writer whom I’m honored to follow and know! I first met Hope at Natashia Deon’s incredibly-curated Dirty Laundry Lit reading series and was instantly inspired by Hope’s story of migration, tenacity, and fittingly, hope. Hope graduated from Northwestern University and received her MFA from New York University. She’s currently revising her first three novels for publication and about to start production on her latest screenplay. In 2010 Hope’s latest piece “feels” had its New York City premiere in a mixed media collaboration at the Joyce Soho Theatre, followed by an encore performance in 2011 as part of the WhiteWave Dance Festival. I can’t wait to read more of her innovative work in coming years—she’s definitely a writer to keep on one’s radar!
