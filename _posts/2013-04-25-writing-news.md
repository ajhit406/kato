title: April's Writing Updates (digest)
lnav: index
---

April was a busy month after travel to Boston, Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou last month for various writing committments (including the amazing Four Stories Reading series in Boston, the launch of Cha's March 2013 issue at Harvard University, and the Shanghai and Beijing Capital International Literary Festivals). I was fortunate to see several pieces published this month. I'm also feverishly working on a story about a critically-endangered Chinese turtle -- more on that soon! 

For now, here's a sampling of new writing published in the last month (or forthcoming) to find here, there, and everywhere:

* 'China Changes Its Tune on Shark Fin Soup' reprinted in [China Daily](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2013-04/26/content_16451992.htm), an article exploring how the shark fin trade is finally meeting its match.
* 'Thoughts of Sinking,' an excerpt from my forthcoming novel _Empire of Glass_ in [Kartika Review's](http://kartikareview.com/?portfolio=issue-15-spring-2013) Spring 2013 issue.
* 'Water for Li-Ming,' an essay I penned about my relationship with my Chinese homestay mother in the renowned China expat anthology [Unsavory Elements](http://www.earnshawbooks.com/content/unsavory-elements), forthcoming US Edition (Summer 2013). The collection can be purchased via the Earnshaw Books site but will be out on Amazon in coming months (expect updates). I'm honored to be included alongside such China literary luminaries as Peter Hessler, Simon Winchester, and Mark Kitto.
* My essay 'Bunking with the Enemy', is forthcoming in anthology [The Places We've Been](http://theplaces35.com/books-are-for-lovers/fiction-and-nonfiction/). The work explores a night I shared a train bunk with the North Korean teenage boys soccer team.
* 'Wang Shuo's Hooligan China,' a book review of Wang Shuo's works in [The Common (Amherst College)](http://www.thecommononline.org/node/1380), a great literary journal out of Amherst College.
* 'Keeping the Chinese Faith in the U.S.,' an Op-Ed exploring the meaning to US-China relations of Lu Lingzi's death during the Boston Marathon bombings earlier this month in [China Daily](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-04/24/content_16444036.htm).

And don't forget to find our most recent curations at [HIPPO Reads](http://www.hipporeads.com), a great source for collected readings on a variety of in-depth and interesting topics.
