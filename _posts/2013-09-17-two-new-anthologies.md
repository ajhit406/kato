title: Essays in Two New Anthologies
lnav: index
---

I'm thrilled that some of my work is featured in these two exciting new anthologies.

The first I've been writing about for quite some time but is now available for purchase on Amazon and in paperback: [Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China](http://www.amazon.com/Unsavory-Elements-Stories-Foreigners-Loose/dp/9881616409/ref=cm_lmf_tit_1) features my essay, "Water, for Li-Ming," which has also received some really kind words in a range of recent book reviews.

The second, [The Places We've Been: Field Reports from Travelers Under 35](http://www.amazon.com/The-Places-Weve-Been-Travelers/dp/0989038904/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1379442973&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=the+places+we%27ve+been+traveler%27s+tales) features my essay, "Bunking with the Enemy," a story about sharing a train cabin with a curious group of North Korean teenagers last year.
