['Tailwind,'](http://www.thecommononline.org/dispatches/tailwind) a 'Dispatch' I wrote from the recent Shanghai and Beijing Capital International Literary Festivals, has been published in The Common. I'm grateful to editor Hannah Gersen for encouraging the piece.

And over at [HIPPO Reads](http://www.hipporeads.com), we are feverishly redesigning a new layout for the site (our Beta.v2, if you will). Expect a new curation soon as well as some exciting announcements!
