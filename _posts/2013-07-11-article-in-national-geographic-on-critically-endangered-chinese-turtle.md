In March I traveled to China's Suzhou Zoo to meet the main caretakers of the world's largest endangered freshwater turtle: the [Rafetus Swinhoei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_giant_softshell_turtle), or Yangtze Giant Softshell Turtle. Although it was a chilly, cloudy day and I couldn't see the turtles (they were hibernating below the surface), I learned a lot about the efforts being made to protect this beautiful creature. 

This month, I reported on the plight of this critically endangered turtle for [National Geographic News](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130703-china-yangtze-giant-softshell-turtle-animal-science/).

Read more [here](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130703-china-yangtze-giant-softshell-turtle-animal-science/) and expect more updates on the Rafetus story in coming months.
