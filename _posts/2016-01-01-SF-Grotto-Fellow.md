I am excited to announce I've been named a <a href="https://www.sfgrotto.org/people/grotto-fellows/>SF Grotto Fellow for 2016</a>. 

As part of the fellowship, I will be allowed a space to work on my writing in the company of the amazing SF Grotto writers for 6 months starting in July. I'm looking forward to the camaraderie and creative space to begin work on my second novel and a number of essays I've been eager to finish, but early motherhood has slowed me down...
