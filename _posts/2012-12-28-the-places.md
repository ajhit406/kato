I'm excited to announce that my essay _Bunking with the Enemy_ will be published in publisher The Places We've Been's inaugural anthology. _Bunking with the Enemy_ explores my experience sharing a train bunk with the Under-15 North Korean Boys Soccer team on my way from Beijing to the North Korean border.
